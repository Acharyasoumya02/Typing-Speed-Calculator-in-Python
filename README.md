## 📝 Description

This project involves developing a Python program that:

- Displays a sentence or paragraph for the user to type.
- Measures the time taken to type the displayed content.
- Calculates the **Typing Speed (WPM)**.
- Checks for **typing accuracy** by comparing the user’s input to the original text.
- Displays feedback based on the results.

## 🚀 Features

- Random or fixed test sentences for typing.
- Real-time timing from start to finish.
- Calculates Words Per Minute (WPM).
- Checks for typing accuracy (character and word-based).
- Console or GUI version (depending on implementation).
